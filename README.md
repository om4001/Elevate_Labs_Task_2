# 🐿️ Central Park Squirrel Census - EDA

This repository contains an **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** of the **2018 Central Park Squirrel Census** dataset using Python libraries such as `pandas`, `matplotlib`, and `seaborn`.

---

## 📊 Objective

Understand squirrel sightings data through:
- Summary statistics
- Visual analysis
- Identification of trends and anomalies

---

## 🧰 Tools Used

- **Python 3**
- **Pandas** – for data manipulation
- **Matplotlib** – for plotting
- **Seaborn** – for statistical visualization

---

## 📂 Dataset

- Dataset Name: `2018_Central_Park_Squirrel_Census_-_Squirrel_Data.csv`
- Source: NYC Open Data
- Contains detailed information on over 3,000 squirrel sightings in Central Park

---

## 📌 Key EDA Tasks Performed

- ✅ Data loading and initial inspection (`head()`, `info()`, `describe()`)
- ✅ Missing value check
- ✅ Histogram of Squirrel Ages
- ✅ Bar chart of Primary Fur Colors
- ✅ Boxplot of Squirrel counts per hectare
- ✅ Correlation Heatmap of numeric features
- ✅ Pairplot of coordinates and counts
- ✅ Pie chart of shift-wise sightings (AM/PM)
- ✅ Countplot of fur color split by shift
- ✅ Scatter plot of geographic locations (X vs Y)
